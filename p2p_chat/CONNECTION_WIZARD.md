## Technical Implementation

### ConnectionWizard Class
The wizard is implemented as a standalone class that can be integrated into any CustomTkinter application:

```python
from p2p_chat.connection_wizard import ConnectionWizard

# Create wizard
wizard = ConnectionWizard(parent_window)

# Set up callbacks
wizard.on_create_chat = your_create_callback
wizard.on_join_chat = your_join_callback
wizard.on_connect_chat = your_connect_callback
wizard.on_wizard_complete = your_complete_callback

# Show wizard
wizard.show()
```

### Integration with ModernChatWindow
The wizard is automatically integrated into the main chat window:

- **Automatic Display** - Shows on app startup instead of simple buttons
- **Seamless Transition** - Smoothly transitions to chat interface when complete
- **Status Updates** - Real-time connection status updates
- **Error Handling** - Integrated error display and recovery

### Key Methods
- `show()` - Display the wizard
- `set_invite_key(key)` - Set invite key for create flow
- `set_return_key(key)` - Set return key for join flow
- `set_connection_status(status, color)` - Update connection status
- `get_username()` - Get current username
- `complete_wizard()` - Complete wizard and transition to chat

## Benefits

### For Users
- **Easier to Use** - Clear step-by-step guidance
- **Less Confusing** - No more wondering what to do next
- **Better Feedback** - Real-time status updates
- **Professional Feel** - Modern, polished interface

### For Developers
- **Modular Design** - Easy to integrate into other applications
- **Extensible** - Easy to add new steps or modify existing ones
- **Maintainable** - Clean separation of concerns
- **Testable** - Can be tested independently

## Configuration

The wizard respects the app's existing settings:
- **Theme** - Automatically uses the current dark/light theme
- **Audio Settings** - Inherits from the main app settings
- **Connection Settings** - Uses the configured STUN servers

## Backward Compatibility

The wizard is designed to be backward compatible:
- **Fallback Support** - Falls back to old interface if wizard fails
- **Same Callbacks** - Uses the same callback interface as before
- **No Breaking Changes** - Existing code continues to work

## Testing

A test script is provided to verify wizard functionality:

```bash
python test_wizard.py
```

This will open a test window showing the wizard interface and testing all major functions.

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements:
- **Tutorial Mode** - Interactive tutorial for first-time users
- **Connection Diagnostics** - Built-in network troubleshooting
- **Custom Themes** - Additional wizard themes
- **Multi-language Support** - Internationalization
- **Accessibility** - Screen reader and keyboard navigation support

The Connection Wizard represents a significant improvement in user experience, making the P2P chat application more accessible and professional while maintaining all existing functionality.
